Chapter Split is a Python tool utilizing pdftk to split a large PDF into chapters. You define chapter boundaries,
and it will split the original file into multiple, single chapter boundaries. You can also define multiple sections 
per new file. For example, you could have Chapter 1, and the answers from the back of the book for Chapter 1, all in 
one PDF.

It takes one argument: filename.
The filename should be a file in the below format. Also see example.txt.


File format:

Original_File_Name.pdf
New_File_Base_ (Will have section name and .pdf attached)
New file name, page_start page_end

Example:

SuperBook.pdf
SuperBook_
Chapter 1, 1 15

Another example using multiple sections (for example, chapter 1 plus chapter 1 answers)

SuperBook.pdf
SuperBook_
Chapter 1, 1 15, 1004 1006
